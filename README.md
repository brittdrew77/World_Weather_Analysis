# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a travel plan between four cities. First, I retrieved weather data by performing an API call on OpenWeatherMap. The data I gathered included: city, country, latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, and weather description. Next, I allowed user input for maximum and minimum temperatures for locations to travel. I found hotels at locations that fit those criteria and displayed a map including pop-up marker descriptions for each fitting location. Lastly, I used the Google Directions API to select four possible travel locations close by and I mapped a route between them.
